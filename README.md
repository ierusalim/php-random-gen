## Random Data Library

The library is easy to get up and running quickly. It is suitable for generating
random bytes or strings from a given character set. It is possible to generate
arrays of arbitrary depth of nesting as well as files with large data structures

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require ierusalim/php-random-gen
```

## Usage


```php
<?php

$r = new RandomStr();

// Generate random 16 characters from default list
$str = $r->genRandomStr(16);

//It works fast. No problem for create random string of 1 million chars
$str = $r->genRandomStr(1000000);
echo "\nGenerated bytes: " . strlen($str);

//Need generate multibyte characters? No problems, set flag $utf8mode = true
$r->setChars("神會貓性少女 迪克和陰部", true);
$str = $r->genRandomStr(888);
```
